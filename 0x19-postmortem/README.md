![Alt text](pic.jpg)


Issue Summary:

    Duration: April 10, 2024, 09:00 AM to April 10, 2024, 11:30 AM (UTC)
    Impact: The 0x19 project website experienced a complete outage during this period, rendering all services inaccessible to users. Approximately 90% of users were affected.
    Root Cause: The outage was caused by a misconfiguration in the load balancer, leading to an overload on the database server and subsequent service degradation.

Timeline:

    09:00 AM (UTC): Issue detected by monitoring alerts indicating a sudden spike in server response times.
    09:05 AM (UTC): I, along with my teammate, began investigating the issue, suspecting a potential database overload due to increased traffic.
    09:20 AM (UTC): Load balancer settings were reviewed, but no immediate issues were identified.
    09:45 AM (UTC): Further investigation revealed a misconfiguration in the load balancer, causing it to improperly distribute traffic, leading to a bottleneck on the database server.
    10:00 AM (UTC): Incident escalated to us, the infrastructure team, for immediate intervention.
    10:30 AM (UTC): Load balancer settings were adjusted by us to evenly distribute traffic, alleviating the strain on the database server.
    11:00 AM (UTC): Service gradually restored as traffic normalized and database performance improved.
    11:30 AM (UTC): Full service functionality restored.

Root Cause and Resolution:

    Root Cause: The root cause of the outage was identified by us as a misconfiguration in the load balancer settings, leading to an uneven distribution of traffic and subsequent overload on the database server.
    Resolution: We adjusted load balancer settings to evenly distribute traffic among available servers, relieving the strain on the database server and restoring service functionality.

Corrective and Preventative Measures:

    Improvements/Fixes:
        Implement regular load balancer configuration audits to detect and prevent misconfigurations.
        Enhance monitoring systems to provide early detection of abnormal traffic patterns.
    Tasks to Address the Issue:
        Conduct a thorough review of load balancer configurations by us to ensure optimal performance.
        Develop and implement automated testing procedures for load balancer configurations by us to prevent future misconfigurations.
        Enhance documentation and training for us as infrastructure team members to improve troubleshooting efficiency during similar incidents.
