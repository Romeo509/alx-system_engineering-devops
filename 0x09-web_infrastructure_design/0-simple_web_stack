Components

What is a server?
-----------------
A server is a computer system or software that provides services or
 resources to other computers, known as clients, over a network.


What is the role of the domain name?
------------------------------------
A domain name is a human-readable alias for an IP address, simplifying
 the way users access websites or services.


What type of DNS record is www in www.foobar.com?
-------------------------------------------------
The DNS record type is a CNAME (Canonical Name) record, pointing 
www to the domain foobar.com.


What is the role of the web server?
-----------------------------------
The web server (Nginx) handles incoming HTTP requests and forwards
 them to the application server. It also serves static content and manages resources.

What is the role of the application server?
---------------------------------------------
The application server executes the application code, processes dynamic content,
 and communicates with the database server.

What is the role of the database?
---------------------------------
The database (MySQL) stores and manages the website's data, providing a
 structured way to retrieve and store information.
What is the server using to communicate with the user's computer requesting the website?

The server communicates with the user's computer using the HTTP protocol over the internet.


Issues with this Infrastructure:

SPOF (Single Point of Failure):
-------------------------------
The entire infrastructure relies on a single server, which poses a risk
 of failure. If the server goes down, the entire website becomes inaccessible.

Downtime during Maintenance:
----------------------------
Deploying new code or performing maintenance on the web server requires
 restarting it, causing downtime during the process.

Limited Scalability:
--------------------
This setup may struggle to handle a large influx of incoming traffic.
 Scaling horizontally (adding more servers) is not currently addressed, limiting scalability.
